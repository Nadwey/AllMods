# All Mods

You've seen All The Mods, but have you seen All Mods?

## Overview

Unlike All The Mods, which puts some focus on quests, progression, and overall playability, this modpack is more about cramming in as many mods as possible.

## Playability (TODO)

- [x] Be able to boot to main menu
- [x] Be able to create and play in a world
- [ ] Fix console spam
- [ ] Review mods
